# Classication-Algorithms
Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machine are the classification algorithms compared in this program. <br/>
In this python program, these classification algorithms are put to the test to see which is the best for spam filtering. <br/> <br/>
**How to run program** <br/>
This program can be run from any python IDE but personally I used Visual Studio Code <br/>
**Results** <br/>
You can also view the results which compares the performance of each classification algorithm on two different datasets in "Algorithm Results" folder. <br/> <br/>

A formal report was written based off the results of each algorithm which can read from "Classification Algorithm Comparison.pdf"
